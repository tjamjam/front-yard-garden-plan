# Burlington Front Yard Edible Landscape Plan

A comprehensive research-based design for transforming a conventional front yard into a productive, beautiful, and low-maintenance edible landscape specifically tailored for Burlington, Vermont's climate (Zone 5a/5b).

## Overview

This repository contains detailed research and planning for creating a sustainable edible landscape that maximizes food production while minimizing ongoing maintenance. The design philosophy centers on working with Vermont's unique climate conditions and investing in upfront soil preparation to create a self-sustaining garden ecosystem.

## Target Audience

- **Primary**: Busy families in Burlington, VT looking to create productive, beautiful front yard landscapes
- **Secondary**: Gardeners in USDA Zones 4-6 interested in permaculture and food forest principles
- **Tertiary**: Landscape designers seeking research-backed plant selections for northern climates

## Key Features

✅ **Climate-Specific Design** - Tailored for Burlington's Zone 5a microclimate with south-facing exposure benefits  
✅ **Low-Maintenance Focus** - Designed to minimize ongoing labor through strategic plant selection and soil preparation  
✅ **Disease-Resistant Varieties** - Emphasizes robust, disease-resistant fruit trees and native plants  
✅ **Multi-Season Interest** - Provides harvests and beauty from spring through fall  
✅ **Ecological Integration** - Incorporates native plants that support local wildlife and pollinators  

## Document Structure

### 1. **Climate Foundation** (Understanding Your Growing Conditions)
- USDA hardiness zone analysis for Burlington
- Microclimate advantages of south-facing sites
- Historical climate trends and implications

### 2. **Soil Preparation** (The "No-Dig" Philosophy)
- Sheet mulching implementation guide
- Long-term soil building strategy
- Labor-saving preparation methods

### 3. **Plant Selection & Design** (The Multi-Layered Approach)
- **Canopy Layer**: Disease-resistant apple varieties ('Liberty', 'Freedom') and cold-hardy peach ('Reliance')
- **Shrub Layer**: Productive berry bushes and native edible shrubs
- **Groundcover Layer**: Living mulch with wild strawberry and aromatic herbs

### 4. **Implementation Guide** (From Plan to Reality)
- Master plant shopping list with Fedco supplier information
- Materials and tools checklist
- Seasonal maintenance calendar

## Plant Highlights

### Fruit Trees (Semi-Dwarf, 12-15 ft mature height)
- **'Liberty' Apple**: Exceptional disease resistance, late summer harvest
- **'Freedom' Apple**: Disease-resistant pollination partner, early fall harvest  
- **'Reliance' Peach**: Cold-hardy Zone 4 variety, mid-summer harvest

### Productive Shrubs
- **'Caroline' Raspberry**: Everbearing variety, fall harvest
- **American Black Elderberry**: Edible flowers and berries, native wildlife support
- **Black Chokeberry**: Antioxidant-rich berries, brilliant fall color

### Living Groundcover
- **Wild Strawberry** (*Fragaria virginiana*): Native groundcover with edible fruit
- **Creeping Thyme**: Drought-tolerant, walkable aromatic carpet
- **Wild Bergamot**: Native pollinator magnet with edible leaves/flowers

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- South-facing front yard with 6+ hours direct sunlight
- Burlington, VT location (or similar Zone 5a/5b climate)
- Commitment to initial soil preparation investment

### Implementation Timeline
- **Fall/Winter**: Order plants from suppliers (Fedco Trees opens late summer)
- **Early Spring**: Implement sheet mulching and bed preparation
- **Late Spring**: Plant trees, shrubs, and perennials after last frost
- **Ongoing**: Follow seasonal maintenance calendar

### Budget Considerations
- **Initial Investment**: Trees ($30-50 each), shrubs ($15-30 each), groundcovers ($5-10 each)
- **Materials**: Cardboard (free), compost (1-2 cubic yards), mulch (2-3 cubic yards)
- **Long-term Savings**: Reduced grocery costs, minimal ongoing inputs after establishment

## Maintenance Philosophy

This design prioritizes **strategic seasonal interactions** over constant maintenance:

- **Spring**: Plant installation and pruning
- **Summer**: Harvest and occasional deep watering during drought
- **Fall**: Main harvest season and final weeding pass
- **Winter**: Dormant season pruning and planning

## Research Foundation

This plan is built on:
- 30+ years of USDA climate data for Burlington area
- Disease resistance research from university extension programs
- Permaculture and food forest design principles
- Native plant ecology and wildlife habitat considerations

## Sources & Citations
